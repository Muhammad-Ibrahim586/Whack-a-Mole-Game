# Whack-a-Mole Game

## Overview
This project presents a simulation of the classic **Whack a Mole** game using Proteus. Practical implementation is also done that demonstrates interactive gameplay through circuit design, showcasing creativity and technical skills in embedded systems.

## Features
1) Simulates a real-time "Whack a Mole" game.
2) Interactive gameplay using electronic components.
3) Designed and tested in Proteus.
4) Practical Implementation on Bread Board

## Files Included
1) **Proteus-Simulation**: Contains the `.pdsprj` file for the game simulation.
2) **Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the circuit design and gameplay implementation.

## Applications
